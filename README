Requires

https://share.realvista.it/svn/lait/GeoserverUtils/

=======
Install
=======

First of all, we need the core library egs-utils (https://share.realvista.it/svn/lait/GeoserverUtils/trunk).
Download and compile it using:

$ mvn clean install

This step will install egs-utils-0.1.jar (version may be different) in maven repository.

Compile EgeosManager by maven:

$ mvn clean package

If all gets well, you can procede to modify Geoserver (http://geoserver.org).
Download the stable release (this version is tested for 2.6.0), war package.
Open the war with a compress program and add the following file in WEB-INF/lib:
  - egeosmanager-0.2.jar (taken in target folder)
  - egs-utils-0.1.jar (taken from maven repository)
  - jasypt-1.9.2.jar (taken from maven repository)
  - commons-codec-1.9.jar (taken from maven repository)
  - commons-io-2.4.jar (taken from maven repository)
  - commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar (taken from maven repository)
  - commons-collections4-4.0.jar (taken from maven repository)

All files should be downloaded during compile task, so you should found them 
in your maven repository. 

After saving, you have to deploy your geoserver.war file.
Keep attenction, this step may delete all data dir, so keep a copy.

====
Note
====

In root folder of the project, there is a deploy.sh, who customize a downloaded
war. You can take a look, if you get a not working geoserver.

Download a Rest Client, the one you love and test the API.
